# tank-engine
A simple model-controller-view framework for small scale PHP projects. Especially designed for data driven applications. Inspired on (but not based upon) Ruby on Rails.

Currently, I am busy setting things up for this project. This project will be a sort of getting-started version, that works more or less out of the box. It will have another project, [Tank Engine core](https://github.com/tdoel/tank-engine-core), as submodule. My first goal is to ensure that this submodule is properly documented. If that is completed, I will return here.
